### Description

Get up and go connect users to events that are happening right now in their area/neighborhood. Once a user logs in, they set their location and are given 3 activity options. Once 4 users in the same area have selected an activity they are notified that the event has been started. They are taken to an event page that lists the location of the event, other 3 users attending, and comment section. Then everyone gets up and goes to the event.
